# Installation


1. Start your PHP server (ex: w/ [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/))

2. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   $ git clone {repos url} 
   ``` 

3. Move to your new repos folder:
  
   ```shell
   $ cd {my new repos folder} 
   ``` 
   
   and install development dependencies w/ [yarn](https://www.https://yarnpkg.com/)
   (Dependencies list is in `package.json`)
   
   ```shell
   // → from @root
   $ yarn
   ```    

4. Define your local environment Name:    
  
    ```shell
    // → from @root
    $ node willybe selectEnv 
    
    // → give your first name to the environment   
    ```
   
    A new environment properties file is created in [config/env/](../properties). 
    Now, you can set a custom Path to your dev environment in this file.
       
    ```shell
    config/                                         
    ├── env/                       
    │       └── env-name.js               # → contains environment name
    │       └── myname.properties.js      # → contains environment path properties
    ```
    
5. Test webpack module bundler
 
   ```shell
   // → webpack + devServer + hot reload
   $ node willybe dev
   
   // → webpack compile assets in dist folder
   $ node willybe production
   ```       
 
6. Test scaffolder Component system: 
  
    ```shell
