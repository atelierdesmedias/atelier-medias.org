A new environment properties file is created in [config/env/](../properties). 
Now, you can set a custom Path to your dev environment in this file.
   
```shell
                                  
properties/                       
    └── .envName                        # → contains current environment name
    └── myname.properties.js            # → contains environment path properties
```
