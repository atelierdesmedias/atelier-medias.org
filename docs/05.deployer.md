# Deployer w/ Gitlab ci

A [gitlab ci](gitlab-ci.yml) file is available in this starter to work with continuous integration.

## Branches

We work only on master branch.

Others branchs are created during deploy process.
- `staging`: is the test production sync this the git branch `staging`
- `production`: is the final online production sync this the git branch `production`

## Methodology 

**Assume you work on the `master` branch.**

1. push on `staging` branch:
```shell 
// from @root
$ deployer/push-master-to-staging.sh
```

2. push on `production` branch:
```shell 
$ deployer/push-staging-to-production.sh
```

### Variables
